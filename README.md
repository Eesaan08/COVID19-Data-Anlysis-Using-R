# COVID-19 Data Analysis with R

This R script aims to analyze a dataset containing information about COVID-19 cases, specifically focusing on factors like age and gender in relation to death rates. The analysis employs the Hmisc package for comprehensive data description and conducts statistical tests to evaluate the significance of certain hypotheses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **R Installation:** Ensure that you have R installed on your machine.
- **Package Installation:** Run `install.packages("Hmisc")` to install the necessary Hmisc package.

### Data
Download the dataset, [COVID19_line_list_data.csv](C:/Users/NischalAremanda/Downloads/COVID19_line_list_data.csv), and place it in the same directory as the R script.

### Running the Script
Execute the provided R script in your preferred R environment.

```R
# Load necessary libraries
rm(list=ls())
install.packages("Hmisc")
require(Hmisc)

# Read the data
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/NischalAremanda/Downloads/COVID19_line_list_data.csv")

# Data Description
describe(data)

# Further Analysis...
# (Include a brief explanation of the analysis steps)
```

## Analysis Highlights

### Death Rate Calculation

A death dummy variable is created to represent whether an individual has succumbed to the virus, and the overall death rate is calculated.

```R
data$death_dummy <- as.integer(data$death != 0)
death_rate <- sum(data$death_dummy) / nrow(data)
```

### Age Analysis

The mean age is calculated for both deceased and alive individuals. A two-sided t-test is performed to assess the statistical significance of any age-related differences.

```R
mean(dead$age, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(alive$age, na.rm = TRUE)
# T-test for statistical significance
t.test(alive$age, dead$age, alternative="two.sided", conf.level = 0.99)
```

### Gender Analysis

Death rates are compared between male and female individuals, and a t-test is employed to determine the statistical significance of any observed differences.

```R
mean(men$death_dummy, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(women$death_dummy, na.rm = TRUE)
# T-test for statistical significance
t.test(men$death_dummy, women$death_dummy, alternative="two.sided", conf.level = 0.99)
```
